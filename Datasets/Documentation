# Data Collection Overview

## 1. Collection Methodology  
We collected the data following a comprehensive methodology to ensure reproducibility and coverage across various IoT device types and operational settings. 
For a detailed explanation of the method, including the experimental setup and the complete list of devices used, please refer to our paper's **Section III-A** and **Appendix C**.

## 2. Ethical Considerations  
The ethical collection and handling of data are of utmost importance in this study. 
We collected data in controlled environments and did not include personal or sensitive information. 
We implemented the following measures:   
- We explicitly obtained consent to use devices in the study where applicable.  
- The collected data did not include personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive user data.  
- All experiments adhered to local regulations and institutional review board (IRB) guidelines to maintain ethical standards.  
- We anonymised the pcap files by removing MAC addresses or other identifiers that could indirectly link the data to a device owner.

## 3. Data Format  
We stored the collected data in **pcap (packet capture)** files, which preserve raw network traffic for subsequent analysis. 
These files include timestamped packets captured during experiments, allowing for detailed device behaviour analysis.
