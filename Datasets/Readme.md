## Overview

The dataset was collected from two regions:
- **United Kingdom (UK), Imperial College London**
- **United States (USA), Goergia Tech Institute**

It includes **packet capture (PCAP)** files representing raw network traffic data generated by various IoT devices under diverse conditions. The data was collected to simulate realistic network environments and ensure coverage of multiple device behaviours.

## Contents

- **PCAP Files:** Captures of network traffic data from IoT devices.
- **Metadata Files:** Descriptions of the IoT devices, operational settings, and environmental conditions during data collection.
- **Documentation:** Details about the collection methodology, ethical considerations, and data format.
