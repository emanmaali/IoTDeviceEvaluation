## Overview

The dataset was collected from two regions:
- **United Kingdom (UK), Imperial College London**
- **United States (USA), Georgia Tech Institute**

It includes **packet capture (PCAP)** files representing raw network traffic data generated by various IoT devices under diverse conditions. The data was collected to simulate realistic smart home environments and ensure coverage of multiple device behaviours.

## Dataset Access
