# IoT Device Identification Models

This directory contains the implementation of machine learning models used for evaluating IoT device identification. The models are categorised into three distinct folds: original code, Docker-based code, and rewritten code from the original paper.

## Overview

The models in this directory were designed to evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of machine learning techniques in identifying IoT devices across different network and operational conditions. These implementations facilitate reproducibility and further exploration.

## Code Folds

### 1. **Original Code**
The following scripts were directly used in the original implementation of the referenced paper:
- 
- 
- 

### 2. **Docker-Based Code**
These scripts are specifically adapted to run within a Docker environment for ease of deployment and reproducibility:
- 
- 
- 

### 3. **Rewritten Code**
To ensure compatibility with modern frameworks and tools, we rewrote the code based on the original paper. This includes optimised implementations and updates:
- 
- 
- 

## Usage

To execute the models, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
