# IoT Device Identification Models

This directory contains the implementation of machine learning models used for evaluating IoT device identification. The models are categorised into three distinct folds: original code, Docker-based code, and rewritten code from the original paper.

## Overview

The models in this directory were designed to evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of machine learning techniques in identifying IoT devices across different network and operational conditions. These implementations facilitate reproducibility and further exploration.

## Code Folds

### 1. **Original Code**
The following are the original implementations from prior research papers. They serve as the baseline for evaluation in this project:
- **[Paper Title 1](https://github.com/author1/original-project-1)**: Brief description of this code’s contribution to IoT device identification.
- **[Paper Title 2](https://github.com/author2/original-project-2)**: Brief description of this code’s contribution to IoT device identification.

### 2. **Docker-Based Code**
These scripts are adapted to run within a Docker environment to ensure ease of deployment and reproducibility:
- **[Paper Title 1](https://github.com/author1/original-project-1)**: Dockerised version of the original implementation.
- **[Paper Title 2](https://github.com/author2/original-project-2)**: Dockerised version of the original implementation.

### 3. **Rewritten Code**
The following implementations are rewritten versions of the original code. They incorporate optimisations for modern frameworks and address any compatibility issues:
- **[Paper Title 1](https://github.com/author1/original-project-1)**: Rewritten and o
