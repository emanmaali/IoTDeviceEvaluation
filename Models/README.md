# IoT Device Identification Models

This directory contains the implementation of machine learning models used for evaluating IoT device identification. The models are categorised into three distinct folds: original code, Docker-based code, and rewritten code from the original paper.

## Overview

The models in this directory were designed to evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of machine learning techniques in identifying IoT devices across different network and operational conditions. These implementations facilitate reproducibility and further exploration.

## Code Folds

### 1. **Original Code**
The following are the original implementations from prior research papers. They serve as the baseline for evaluation in this project:
- **[Ahmed22](https://github.com/dilawer11/iot-device-fingerprinting)**: Analyzing the Feasibility and Generalizability of Fingerprinting Internet of Things Devices.

### 2. **Docker-Based Code**
These scripts are adapted to run within a Docker environment to ensure ease of deployment and reproducibility:
- **[Dong20](https://github.com/KiteFlyKid/Your-Smart-Home-Can-t-Keep-a-Secret-Towards-Automated-Fingerprinting-of-IoT-Traffic-with-Neural-Net.git)**: Your smart home can't keep a secret: Towards automated fingerprinting of IoT traffic.
- **[Fan22](https://github.com/AliceAndBobCandy/AutoIoT.git)**: AutoIoT: Automatically Updated IoT Device Identification With Semi-Supervised Learning.

### 3. **Rewritten Code**
The following implementations are rewritten versions of the original code. They incorporate optimisations for modern frameworks and address any compatibility issues:
- **[Meid20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404820302418)**: A novel approach for detecting vulnerable IoT devices connected behind a home NAT.
- **[Okui22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9842469)**: Identification of an IoT device model in the home domain using IPFIX records.
- **[Siva18](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8440758)**: Classifying IoT Devices in Smart Environments Using Network Traffic Characteristics.
- **[Pinh19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140366419300052)**: Identifying IoT devices and events based on packet length from encrypted traffic.
- **[Yang19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128618306856)**: Towards automatic fingerprinting of IoT devices in the cyberspace.
- **[Ortiz19](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3302505.3310073)**: DeviceMien: Network device behavior modeling for identifying unknown IoT devices.
